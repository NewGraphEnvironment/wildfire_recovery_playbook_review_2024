# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Let's face it - its annoying putting out documents for review. Let's get a bunch of flack for giving it our all.
It's great that you are doing it. Smart. Considerate. You have done an excellent job and we are very grateful for the 
opportunity to provide feedback. We hope it does not come across as too critical as overall we are very impressed with 
the work that has been done and look forward to mining the document for resources and ideas for our own projects.

Thank you!!!
