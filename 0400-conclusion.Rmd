# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

It can't be fun putting out documents for review. It's great that you are doing that. Smart. You have done an excellent 
job and we are very grateful for the opportunity to review the playbook. We hope that our feedback does not come across 
as too critical as overall we are very impressed with the work that has been done and look forward to mining the document 
for resources and ideas for our own projects.

Thank you!!!
