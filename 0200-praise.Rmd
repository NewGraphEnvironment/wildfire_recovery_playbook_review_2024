1. The playbook is well organized, well written and easy to follow. It must have taken forever to write and all the
contributors should be showered in praise for their efforts and should be super proud of the final product.
2. The playbook is comprehensive and covers most the necessary topics. The content is well researched and we are confident
the information we are familiar with is accurate. 
3. The playbook is a valuable resource for anyone involved in wildfire recovery with the links to external resources are 
particularly helpful.
