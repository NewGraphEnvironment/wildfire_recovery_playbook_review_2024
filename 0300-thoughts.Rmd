# A Few Thoughts {-}

## Reproducability {-}
There does not seem to be a lot of information regarding the value of reproducability for restoration planning and from
our perspective that is a major opportunity for progress... For example - the use of scripts to automate workflows and
the sharing of workflows online.  From our perspective, there is extraordinary value in using scripts and packages to
automate workflows and promote collaboration. Rather than each professional doing their own analysis on their own custom
datasets with many ad-hoc workflows it should be encouraged that professionals move towards well documented -
reproducible open-source programming workflows using scripting languages like `R`, `sql` and `python`. Examples of the
types of packages that can be used to automate workflows are presented
[here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/blob/main/data/aquatic_restoration_resources.csv).

## Software Tools for Reproducability {-}

Although many of the resources in the above linked csv are reports (containing scripted workflows) there are also many
stand-alone software tools.  An example of a tool key for reproducible workflows is
[bcdata](https://github.com/smnorris/bcdata) [@norris2024smnorrisbcdata] which is a package that allows the user to
access data from the [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/).  This package can be used to build a mirror
of government data that is used in projects. Because the loading of data to a `postgres` database is done automatically
and the names of the data `schemas` and `tables` are equivalent to those served out by the province - GIS analysis is
portable and analysis can be rerun with fresh data over time. This facilitates collaboration and reproducability on a
level that is not achievable without much more effort and skill than is required when not using a tool such as this.
Other key tools include [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) [@norris2024smnorrisfwapg] and
[bcfishpass](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass) [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishpass] among others.

There are many wonderful conceptual workflows presented in the Wildfire Restoration Playbook and some text that
indicates that investments should be made so these workflows can be automated and shared openly to the greatest extent
possible would be a great addition to the document.  A great example of a conceptual workflow that could be automated
(with the help of packages like bcdata!) is Presented in Figure 24 - "Conceptualization of combining spatial data (GIS)
on hazards and consequences to visualize wildfire risk on a single 2-dimensional wildfire “risk map”. Adapted from
Alwathaf and Mansouri (2011)."

## Open Source - Iterative Reporting {-}
There is a key question we have been asking ourselves lately and that is 

<br>

    
  >"What is the most useful way to present information?" 
  
<br>
  

From our perspective - the most useful way to present information is in a version controlled format that allows it to be
interactive, reproducible, read online, served out as a static document, updated,  copied, used as a template, etc.
Iterative reporting, managed with a version control system such as
[git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git) (see example of tracking edits [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/commits/main/0300-thoughts.Rmd))
with a permissive license is a great way to do all
those things.  Although there is a steep learning curve to using programming tools and producing this type of product
and although it can be quite time consuming - it then allows leveraging of all the components of the work to future
projects for everyone. Licenseing is also key and should be considered.
[Here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/blob/main/LICENSE) is an example of
a license that promotes collaboration and sharing/leveraging of work.

<br>

From our perspective - the playbook is the type of document that is well suited to an iterative reporting format such as
can be demonstrated within this [code
repository](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024) which builds and serves this
[online report](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/). We would like to suggest
that in future iterations, it be considered that the playbook is converted to a dynamic document because:

### Tables and Figures {-}
There are an incredible number of tables within the document that may have taken a very long time to format.  We suggest
the tables be converted to simple csvs or pages of an excel workbook and pulled into the project using scripts. This
would allow others to access the data and use it in their own projects.  The tables could also then be easily updated
with new data as it becomes available and the formatting would be handled by the scripting. An example of this can be
seen here in Table \@ref(tab:kable-resources) with the actual file served
[here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/tree/main/data):

```{r kable-resources}
read_csv("data/aquatic_restoration_resources.csv") %>%
  fpr::fpr_kable()
```

<br>
 
Any figures used in the reporting could be saved in the project and used by anyone else in their work to tell there own
story and help their teams achieve their goals.  An example of this can be seen here Table \@ref(tab:kable-resources)
with the actual file served
[here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/blob/main/fig/collaboration.jpg).

```{r fig-collaboration}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/collaboration.jpg")
```

 - The references in the Wildfire Restoration Playbook are incredible. There are so many and they are extremely valuble.
 Thank you. To maximize the value of these references, they should be tabulated within a references section at the end
 of the report and documented in a `.bib` file that can be imported and exported to and from a reference manager such as
 `Zotero` or `Mendeley`.  This would allow the references to be transferred all at once to others libraries so they can
 be used in other projects and updated as needed.  An example of this can be seen
 [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/blob/main/book.bib).


 - The document is necessarily fairly lengthy longish and from some perspectives may be considered a touch difficult to
 navigate. It would be helpful to have the report served online with a table of contents on the left hand side that
 allows the reader to jump to each section. An example of this can be seen
 [here](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/). In this particular situation
 this is done useing the open source package `bookdown` and the document is served by [github
 pages](https://pages.github.com/).
 
 - Although it requires a bit of gymnastics to get it set up the
 document can also be served in a way that allows the reader to download updated pdf versions of the report that are
 formatted for printing and suitable for upload to a central database such as `Ecocat`. An example of this can be seen
 [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/) where a download button at the top left
 of the document allows the user to download a pdf version of the report from [this url](
 https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/blob/master/docs/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024.pdf).
 
 
 
## Collaborative GIS {-}

Geographical Information Systems are essential for understanding restoration plans and the reasons they are required.
Without the ability to visualize the landscape and the data that is used to make decisions it is difficult to
communicate the need for restoration and the potential benefits.  We suggest that the collaborative GIS environments be
mentioned as a key tool for restoration planning.  Although there are many tools for sharing spatial information we
have been finding that [Mergin Maps](https://merginmaps.com/) (source code [here](https://github.com/MerginMaps) -
which leverages the open source QGIS software - is a great tool for sharing spatial data, collaborating on spatial
analysis and even collecting standardized data on our phones. Maybe worth a mention.
