# A Few Thoughts {-}

## Reproducability {-}
There does not seem to be a lot of information regarding the value of reproducability for restoration planning and from
our perspective that is a major barrier to progress... For example - the use of scripts to automate workflows and the
sharing of workflows online.  From our perspective, there is extraordinary value in using scripts and packages to
automate workflows and promote collaboration. Rather than each professional doing their own analysis on their own custom
datasets with many points and clicks it should be encouraged that professionals contribute to open-source programming
that allows centralization of workflows. Examples of the types of packages that can be used to automate workflows are
presented [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/aquatic_restoration_resources.csv).

## Tools for Reproducability {-}

Although many of the resources in the above linked csv are reports there are also many tools.  An example of a key tool is
[bcdata](https://github.com/smnorris/bcdata) which is a package that allows the user to access data from the BC Data
Catalogue.  We use this package to build a mirror of government data that is used in our projects. Because the loading
of data to a `postgres` database is done automatically and the names of the data `schemas` and `tables` are equivalent
to those served out by the province our GIS analysis is portable and analysis can be rerun with fresh data over time. We
can collaborate on a level that is not achievable without much more effort and skill than is required when not using a
tool such as this that facilitates reproducability. Other key tools include [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) and [bcfishpass](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass) amoung others.

There are many wonderful conceptual workflows presented in this report and some text that indicates that investments
should be made so these workflows can be automated and shared openly to the greatest extent possible would be a great
addition to the document.  A great example of a conceptual workflow that could be automated (with the help of packages
like bcdata!) is Presented in Figure 24 - "Conceptualization of combining spatial data (GIS) on hazards and consequences
to visualize wildfire risk on a single 2-dimensional wildfire “risk map”. Adapted from Alwathaf and Mansouri (2011)."

## Open Source - Iterative Reporting {-}
There is a key question we have been asking ourselves lately and that is 

<br>

    
  >"What is the most useful way to present information?" 
  
<br>
  

From our perspective - the most useful way to present information is in a version controlled format that allows it to be
interactive, reproducible, read online, served out as a static document, updated,  copied, used as a template, etc.
Iterative reporting with a permissive license is a great way to do all those things.  Although there is a steep learning
curve to produce this type of product and it can be quite time consuming - it then allows leveraging of all the
components of the work to future projects for everyone. Licenseing is also key and should be considered.  Here is an
example of a license that promotes collaboration and sharing of work
[here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/blob/main/LICENSE).

<br>

From our perspective - the playbook is the type of document that is well suited to an iterative reporting format such as
can be demonstrated within this [code
repository](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024) which builds and serves this
[online report](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/). We would like to suggest
that in future iterations, it be considered that the playbook is converted to a dynamic document because:

### Tables and Figures {-}
There are an incredible number of tables within the document that may have taken a very long time to format.  We suggest
the tables be converted to simple csvs or pages of an excel workbook and pulled into the project using scripts. This
would allow others to access the data and use it in their own projects.  The tables could also then be easily updated
with new data as it becomes available and the formatting would be handled by the scripting. An example of this can be
seen here in Table \@ref(tab:kable-resources) with the actual file served
[here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/tree/main/data):

```{r kable-resources}
read_csv("data/aquatic_restoration_resources.csv") %>%
  fpr::fpr_kable()
```

<br>
 
Any figures used in the reporting could be saved in the project and used by anyone else
 in their work to tell there own story and help their teams achieve their goals.  An example of this can be seen here 
 Table \@ref(tab:kable-resources) with the actual file served [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/blob/main/fig/collaboration.jpg): 

```{r fig-collaboration}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/collaboration.jpg")
```

 - The references in this document are incredible. There are so many and they are extremely valuble. Thank you. To
 maximize the value of these references, they could be saved in a `.bib` file that can be imported into a reference 
 manager such as `Zotero` or `Mendeley`.  This would allow the references to be transferred all at once to others libraries
 so they can be used in other projects and updated as needed.  An example of this can be seen [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/blob/main/book.bib).


 - The document is quite long and from some perspectives may be considered a touch difficult to navigate.  It would be
 helpful to have the report served online with a table of contents on the left hand side that allows the reader to jump
 to the section. An example of this can be seen
 [here](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/). In this particular situation
 this is done useing the open source package `bookdown` and the document is served by [github
 pages](https://pages.github.com/).
 
 - Although it requires a bit of gymnastics to get it set up the
 document can also be served in a way that allows the reader to download updated pdf versions of the report that are formatted
 for printing and suitable for upload to a central database such as `Ecocat`. An example of this can be seen [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/) where a download button at the top left of the
 document allows the user to download a pdf version of the report from [this url](
 https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024/blob/master/docs/wildfire_recovery_playbook_review_2024.pdf).
